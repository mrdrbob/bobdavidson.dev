There's not actually much interesting here (except <em>maybe</em> the <a href="https://github.com/mrdrbob/bobdavidson.dev/blob/main/gulpfile.js">Gulp file that builds everything</a>), but perhaps someone will find something useful here.</p>

      <p>Another year and another attempt at <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent of Code</a>. Once again, I did not finish, though I made it slightly farther than before (day 15). And once again I tried it in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rust</a>. You can read my development diary as I worked through the syntax and logic. I've not used systems languages much, but I've had much greater success with Rust than I have any other systems language. It's not quite ready to be a part of my day job, but I see why it has such buzz.</p>

      <p>I started playing around a bit with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godot</a>, following some tutorials and building a very rough, proof-of-concept side-scrolling platformer. In the <a href="https://github.com/mrdrbob/godot-test">Github repo</a>, you can find all my files and read through my development diary as I tried to figure out just what the heck I was doing. Overall, though, I'm extremely impressed with how polished Godot is, and how quickly a person can get up and running.</p>
