    "description": "I started playing around a bit with Godot, following some tutorials and building a very rough, proof-of-concept side-scrolling platformer. In the Github repo, you can find all my files and read through my development diary as I tried to figure out just what the heck I was doing. Overall, though, I'm extremely impressed with how polished Godot is, and how quickly a person can get up and running."
