    "description": "Another year and another attempt at Advent of Code. Once again, I did not finish, though I made it slightly farther than before (day 15). And once again I tried it in Rust. You can read my development diary as I worked through the syntax and logic. I've not used systems languages much, but I've had much greater success with Rust than I have any other systems language. It's not quite ready to be a part of my day job, but I see why it has such buzz."
